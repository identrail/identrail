- Threat: Webhook URL using plain HTTP can leak sensitive finding context.
- Fix: Require `https` for remote endpoints (allow `http` only for localhost development).
- Status: Implemented.

## 18) Invalid Scoped Key Still Reads API Data
- Threat: A key with an unknown scope might authenticate but still read sensitive endpoints.
- Fix: Enforce readable scope on `/v1/*`; `write` implies `read`.
- Status: Implemented.

## 19) Misconfigured Write-Key List
- Threat: Write key exists but is not allowed in base API key list, causing broken or confusing auth behavior.
- Fix: Startup validation rejects invalid legacy write-key configuration.

- Threat: A single webhook failure can drop a critical alert.
- Fix: Bounded retry/backoff for transient failures.
- Status: Implemented.

## 26) Insecure Audit Forwarding Transport
- Threat: Forwarding audit events over insecure transport can leak sensitive request metadata.
- Fix: Require `https` for remote audit forwarding URLs (allow `http` only for localhost).

- Fix: Explicit `snake_case` JSON tags on domain response models + frontend contract tests.
- Status: Implemented.

## 32) Wrong Baseline Selection Skews Drift Analysis
- Threat: Comparing a scan against an invalid baseline (same scan, newer scan, or different provider) gives misleading risk movement.
- Fix: Validate `previous_scan_id` strictly and reject invalid baselines with `400`.
- Status: Implemented.

## 33) Namespace/Subject Drift in Kubernetes Role Bindings
- Threat: A role binding subject with missing namespace/name can map privileges to the wrong identity or produce noisy graph edges.
- Fix: Normalize only valid service account subjects and skip malformed subjects/bindings.
- Status: Implemented.

## 34) Environment Drift Across Deployment Targets
- Threat: Different host/container/cluster setups can drift in env vars and weaken security controls.
- Fix: Ship versioned deployment profiles and env templates (Docker, Kubernetes, systemd) with explicit required variables.
- Status: Implemented.

- Status: Implemented.

## 37) RBAC Role-Name Heuristic Drift
- Threat: Inferring Kubernetes permissions from role names alone (`cluster-admin`, `view`, etc.) can miss or misstate custom-role privileges.
- Fix: Collect `Role`/`ClusterRole` assets and derive policy statements from concrete RBAC `rules`; keep fallback heuristics only when role data is missing.
- Status: Implemented.

## 38) Secret Value Retention in Repository Leak Findings
- Threat: Repository leak scanning can accidentally persist raw secret values into logs, scan artifacts, or API payloads.
- Fix: Store only secret fingerprints and redacted snippets; never store raw secret values in findings evidence.
- Status: Implemented.

## 39) Unbounded Repository Scan Blast Radius
- Threat: Unbounded repo scans can consume resources or scan out-of-scope repositories in shared environments.
- Fix: Enforce bounded history/findings limits and optional repo allowlist (`IDENTRAIL_REPO_SCAN_ALLOWLIST`) with write-protected API trigger.
- Status: Implemented.

## 40) Repo Scan Data Mixing with Cloud Scan Records
- Threat: Storing repository findings in existing cloud scan tables can break client assumptions and pollute cloud risk workflows.
- Fix: Persist repository scan lifecycle and findings in dedicated tables with dedicated API endpoints.
- Status: Implemented.

## 41) Concurrent Repo Scans on Same Target
- Threat: API-triggered and worker-triggered repo scans on the same target can overlap and produce duplicated workload.
- Fix: Add per-target single-flight lock (`repo-scan:<target>`) and return conflict (`409`) for in-flight target scans.

- Status: Implemented.

## 45) OIDC-Only Deployments Accidentally Running Unauthenticated
- Threat: If API key lists are empty and OIDC auth is configured incorrectly in middleware, `/v1/*` could become unintentionally open.
- Fix: Enforce auth middleware for OIDC-only mode and require a valid verified bearer token when API keys are absent.
- Status: Implemented.

## 46) Inconsistent Write Authorization Across API Keys and OIDC Scopes
- Threat: Mixed auth modes can allow write endpoints without explicit write scope checks.
- Fix: Normalize auth scopes in middleware and enforce write access via `write` scope (or admin) for both scoped keys and OIDC tokens.
- Status: Implemented.

## 47) Graph Semantic Drift
- Threat: New or mistyped relationship names can silently enter storage and break path logic and findings.
- Fix: Validate relationships against an explicit supported semantic contract, including precise AWS machine and agent identity edge types, and enforce fixture-based contract tests.
- Status: Implemented.

## 48) Non-Deterministic Finding Evidence
- Threat: Same scan input can produce evidence in different orders, creating noisy diffs and reducing operator trust.
- Fix: Sort risk evidence deterministically before generating findings and cover with determinism tests.
- Status: Implemented.

## 49) Thundering-Herd Retry Under AWS Throttling
- Threat: Synchronized retries during IAM rate limits can worsen outage duration and throttling pressure.
- Fix: Add bounded jitter to AWS retry backoff.
- Status: Implemented.

## 50) Silent Partial Collector Failures
- Threat: Collector decode/source issues can be dropped silently, leading operators to trust incomplete scan output.
- Fix: Add diagnostic collector contract and surface source errors in scan lifecycle events.
- Status: Implemented.

## 51) Normalized Schema Drift at Runtime
- Threat: Missing/invalid normalized fields can persist malformed entities and break graph/risk logic later.

- Status: Implemented.

## 52) Graph Edge Drift and Duplicate Semantics
- Threat: Duplicate or invalid relationship edges can inflate privilege paths and cause unstable findings.
- Fix: Enforce graph endpoint contract, relationship ID uniqueness, semantic tuple uniqueness, and required discovery timestamp.

- Threat: One transient failure in scheduled runs can cause missed scans without retry.
- Fix: Add bounded scheduler retries with exponential backoff and dead-letter callback on exhaustion.
- Status: Implemented.

- Fix: Emit explicit `partial` lifecycle state and warning events with truncated source-error evidence.
- Status: Implemented.

## 55) API Sort Drift Across Clients
- Threat: Different clients can interpret ordering differently, creating inconsistent findings/scans views.
- Fix: Standardize list sorting with `sort_by` and `sort_order` query parameters across `/v1` list endpoints.
- Status: Implemented.

## 56) Contract Drift Between API and Integrations
- Threat: Endpoint/parameter drift can break dashboard and external automation unexpectedly.
- Fix: Publish and test a versioned OpenAPI v1 contract (`docs/openapi-v1.yaml` + contract tests).
- Status: Implemented.

## 57) Misleading CLI Risk Prioritization
- Threat: Lexical severity ordering can hide highest-severity findings lower in table output.
- Fix: Deterministic severity-rank sorting in CLI table output.
- Status: Implemented.

## 58) Unverified Migration Rollback Path
- Threat: Rollback scripts may exist but fail during incident pressure if never validated.

- Status: Implemented.

## 61) Weak API Key Entropy in Runtime Config
- Threat: Short API keys are easier to brute force and often reused across environments.
- Fix: Add startup security warning for keys shorter than recommended entropy length.
- Status: Implemented.

## 62) Hidden Degradation in Scan Health Dashboards
- Threat: Without explicit success/failure/partial counters, operators cannot detect scan health drift quickly.
- Fix: Add dedicated scan outcome metrics and repo scan reliability metrics.
- Status: Implemented.

## 63) Missing End-to-End Trace Across Scan Pipeline
- Threat: Debugging stage-level bottlenecks or failures is slower without scanner stage traces.
- Fix: Add OpenTelemetry spans for collect/normalize/permissions/relationships/risk stages.
- Status: Implemented.

## 64) IaC Drift in Deployment Artifacts
- Threat: Helm/Terraform drift can reach production when artifacts are not validated in CI.
- Fix: Add CI gates for `helm lint` and `terraform validate`.
- Status: Implemented.

- Status: Implemented.

## 67) Legacy Persisted Row Parsing Regressions
- Threat: Existing rows with nullable/legacy field combinations may fail parse/export after migration or mapper changes.
- Fix: Add integration compatibility test that seeds legacy rows and validates list/export behavior.
- Status: Implemented.

## 68) Unqualified Release Tagging
- Threat: RC/GA tags can be pushed without complete quality evidence, causing unstable production releases.
